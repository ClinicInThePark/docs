### Assessment

1) What did we deliver to our sponsors at the end of spring quarter? 

+ A completed website, which will be taken live by Mark Raymond himself, the CitP Webmaster.
+ A redesigned "passport" design that will eventually be used for data collection at Health and Wellness Clinic events.
+ A functional database in which to store users, events, and services.
+ An interactive interface mockup of the system.
+ A login/logout (including user creation and viewability) system connected to the database. 

2) What feedback did we receive from our sponsors?

+ Our sponsors were happy with our progress, and are looking forward to seeing how the project will continue to unfold this summer and beyond.

3) What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?

Functional Requirements:
+ The tracking system interface must be accessible through a portal on the CitP website.
+ A user must be granted (or denied) access to a particular dashboard based on their user status of either "visitor" or "staff."
+ Users must be provided an option to retrieve their login credentials.
+ Each dashboard must allow users to select from a list of Health and Wellness Clinic events.
+ The information displayed on each dashboard must automatically update based on which Health and Wellness Clinic event is currently selected.
+ Visitor Dashboard must display information based on services received by the visitor at a given Health and Wellness Clinic event.
+ Staff Dashboard must display information based on a given Health and Wellness Clinic event as a whole.
+ Staff Dashboard must allow user to add new, view, and edit existing users, events, services, and specialized documentation to be displayed.

Nonfunctional Requirements:
+ The interface as a whole needs to be clean, simple, and minimalistic in design.
+ The system needs to be easily-maintainable into the future.
+ The system may need to be made HIPAA-compliant. This will depend on information we will receive from our sponsors regarding where they would like to host the system, and whether or not resulting requirments are too demanding.
+ The system needs to be reliable and efficient.
+ It should not take longer than five seconds to load anything.

4) What other work do you need to do to deliver the final product?
+ A sutiable place to host the system will need to be located. Our sponsors are currently looking into this for us.
+ We need to further refine the login/logout system. 
+ A tutorial will need to be arranged to train users on how to use the system. 
+ A series of detailed documentation on system maintenance will need to be created.


5) Are there some requirements for the final product that are not yet clear? If so, how can you get clear about them?

  
6) What is the most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product?
+ The most important work to make progress towards the final product is managing to connect to the database through the website.

7) What skills are needed to do this work?
+ The skills we will need are: programming in PHP/SQL, knowledge of web servers.

7) Who in the team has these skills? Who does not?
+ With the exception of Eric, the rest are new to programming in PHP/SQL and using web servers.  

8) How can team members without these skills get them?
+ Team members without these skills will be able to acquire (and reach a satisfactory level) by reading PHP/SQL documentation and working on small side projects to put their new knowledge to test.
