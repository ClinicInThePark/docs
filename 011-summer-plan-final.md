#Assessment

1) What did we deliver to our sponsors at the end of spring quarter? 

+ A completed website, which will be taken live by Mark Raymond himself, the CitP Webmaster.
+ A redesigned "passport" design that will eventually be used for data collection at Health and Wellness Clinic events.
+ A functional database in which to store users, events, and services.
+ An interactive interface mockup of the system.
+ A login/logout (including user creation and viewability) system connected to the database. 

2) What feedback did we receive from our sponsors?


##### Functional Requirements met

 Database:

+ Create a database to store client information.
+ If accessed with a valid account, the database should lead to the user interface.
+ If accessed with a patient account, patients are not allowed to input information.
+ If acessed with staff accounts, staff are allowed to input and change information on patient accounts.

 Website management:
 
+ The system will provide a box on the website for users to subscribe to the Clinic in the Park emails (flyers, newsletters, etc).
+ Allow the website to have be interactive with the database and allow patients and staff to access the website for patient information.

##### Non-functional Requirements met
+ Needs to be accessibile to providers at other healthcare establishments.
+ Must be able to quickly and easily backup information.


2) What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?

##### Functional Requirements that remain to be met
 Website management:
 
+ Staff can input information into the database through the website. 
+ Patients can access database through website to look over medical information from Clinic in the Park check-ups

###### Miscellaneous
+ If a user presses the "recover password" button, it will lead the user to a page asking for the user ID and the answer for a previously picked security question.
+ If a user presses the "forgot ID and password" button, the user is sent an email to the email he or she used for making the account. 


##### Non-functional Requirements that remain to be met
+ Needs to be easily-maintainable going into the future.
+ Must be HIPAA-compliant and in line with privacy and other security concerns.
+ Usability needs to be focused on visitors and providers that attend Clinic in the Park event.

+ Needs to be reliable and efficient.
+ Must not take longer than 5 seconds to load anything.

3) What other work do you need to do to deliver the final product?
  + We need to finish implementing the login system. Other work we need to do are the following: 
   + design and implement the user interface for dashboard both the staff and visitors interact with. 
   + Successfully connect the database to the website. This task will be considered done if we are able to access the database through the website.
   + Write a tutorial and detailed documentation on maintaining the electronic system for future people modifying our work (tentative, might not be necessary). 

4) Are there some requirements for the final product that are not yet clear? If so, how can you get clear about them?

  
5) What is the most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product?
  + The most important work to make progresss towards the final product is managing to connect to the database through the website.

7) Who in the team has these skills? Who does not?
  + With the exception of Eric, the rest are new to programming in PHP/SQL and using web servers.  
  
8) How can team members without these skills get them?
  + Team members without these skills will be able to acquire (and reach a satisfactory level) by reading PHP/SQL documentation and working on small side projects to put their new knowledge to test.
