# Clinic in the Park
## Team CitP 

Eric Acampora, Eddie Duong, Ka Lun Lee, Hugo Polanco

### Assessment

1) What did we deliver to our sponsors at the end of spring quarter? 

+ A completed website, which will be taken live by Mark Raymond himself, the CitP Webmaster.
+ A redesigned "passport" design that will eventually be used for data collection at Health and Wellness Clinic events.
+ A functional database in which to store users, events, and services.
+ An interactive interface mockup of the system.
+ A login/logout (including user creation and viewability) system connected to the database. 

2) What feedback did we receive from our sponsors?

+ Our sponsors were happy with our progress, and are looking forward to seeing how the project will continue to unfold this summer and beyond.

3) What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?

Functional Requirements:
+ The tracking system interface must be accessible through a portal on the CitP website.
+ A user must be granted (or denied) access to a particular dashboard based on their user status of either "visitor" or "staff."
+ Users must be provided an option to retrieve their login credentials.
+ Each dashboard must allow users to select from a list of Health and Wellness Clinic events.
+ The information displayed on each dashboard must automatically update based on which Health and Wellness Clinic event is currently selected.
+ Visitor Dashboard must display information based on services received by the visitor at a given Health and Wellness Clinic event.
+ Staff Dashboard must display information based on a given Health and Wellness Clinic event as a whole.
+ Staff Dashboard must allow user to add new, view, and edit existing users, events, services, and specialized documentation to be displayed.

Nonfunctional Requirements:
+ The interface as a whole needs to be clean, simple, and minimalistic in design.
+ The system needs to be easily-maintainable into the future.
+ The system may need to be made HIPAA-compliant. This will depend on information we will receive from our sponsors regarding where they would like to host the system, and whether or not resulting requirments are too demanding.
+ The system needs to be reliable and efficient.
+ It should not take longer than five seconds to load anything.

4) What other work do you need to do to deliver the final product?
+ A sutiable place to host the system will need to be located. Our sponsors are currently looking into this for us.
+ We need to further refine the login/logout system. 
+ A tutorial will need to be arranged to train users on how to use the system. 
+ A series of detailed documentation on system maintenance will need to be created.


5) Are there some requirements for the final product that are not yet clear? If so, how can you get clear about them?
+ One big potential requirement that we are still unsure on is the question of HIPPA complicany. Our sponsors will be talking with the informatics team at the UCI Medical Center about the project, and will possibly arrange a meeting for us with them if it is decided that this project will truly need to abide by HIPPA regulation.
+ We will continually question our sponsors until we receive a 'yes' or 'no' asnwer, so that we can safely proceed with the project without running into too many problems regarding this concern.

6) What is the most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product?
+ The most important work will be implementing the dashboard information windows. This embodies essential functionality, such as how information will be selected based on user type, and how that information will automatically populate these windows based on current event date selection.

7) What skills are needed to do this work?
+ The skills we will need are: programming in PHP/SQL, knowledge of web servers. Also, general knowledge of HTML/CSS.

7) Who in the team has these skills? Who does not?
+ With the exception of Eric, the rest are new to programming in PHP/SQL and using web servers.  

8) How can team members without these skills get them?
+ Team members without these skills will be able to acquire (and reach a satisfactory level) by reading PHP/SQL documentation and working on small side projects to put their new knowledge to test. 

### Timeline

#### Sponsor Meetings
Beginning on the week of June 23, we will be meeting with our sponsor Kristin Alix every two weeks via Google Hangouts. Once a month, we will meet with our sponsors in person at the CitP office.

We pledge to never leave a meeting without arranging a date for the next.

#### Biweekly Communication Structure (with Professor Ziv and Six)
We will be communicating with Professor Ziv and Six over email. Our first communication update will be on Saturday, June 13, but the following updates will take place every two weeks on Fridays, following the structure below:
+ Friday, June 27
+ Friday, July 11
+ Friday, July 25
+ Friday, August 8
+ Friday, August 22
+ Friday, September 5
+ Friday, September 17
+ Thursday, October 2 (according to Professor Ziv, this will likely be in form of progress report)

#### Learning Tasks
+ Ka Lun: Learn PHP/SQL, work on web authentication and implimentation. 
+ Eric: I will be further familiarizing myself with CakePHP, determining the best way to separate content for two user types (Visitor and Staff), thinking about best ways to allow staff-side users to interact with the database (adding new data, viewing data, and editing existing data), and last but not least, researching best way to approach visual design of the interface.
+ Hugo: I will focus this summer to learn more skills with PHP/SQL and CSS. I don't have too much skills on those two languages/frameworks so I plan on getting more experience and doing projects with that.
+ Eddie: I will mainly focus on learning PHP/SQL and getting familiar with CakePHP.

#### Communication Tasks
+ Ka Lun: Update team with what I did every week
+ Ka Lun: Google Hangsout with sponsor/team every 2 weeks.
+ Eric: Updating my team on my accomplishments each week, virtual Google Hangout with Kristin every two weeks, and monthly meeting with our sponsors at CitP office. I pledge to never take more than a day to respond to a team member unless in case of emergency, or if I have previously notified them that I will be unavailable for an extended period of time. I will also be updating Professor Ziv and Six every two weeks (based on the above communication structure) on our progress via email. 
+ Hugo: I plan on updating my team with the progress of my projects every week as well as meeting with my sponsors/team every 2 weeks. If there is a particular day I can't meet for any reason, I plan on making my teammates aware.

#### Implementation Tasks
+ Ka Lun: Implementing visitor dashboard.
+ Eric: Working towards refining login/logout system, helping with events selection functionality and automated information update, and helping with population of dashboard information window. I also plan on specifically looking at how services will be managed by staff-side users.
+ Learning more skills with Cake PHP/SQL as well as CSS, then helping out with the refinement of the login/logout system.

#### Testing Tasks
+ Ka Lun: Dashboard functionality: Making sure information is being displayed on the visitor dashboard.
+ Eric: Will be continually debugging code and planning on performing cognitive walkthroughs with staff members. 
+ Hugo: Website maintenance as well as dashboard functionality once I have more experience with PHP/SQL & CSS.

#### Deployment Tasks
+ Ka Lun: Test connecting between visitor login and visitor dashboard. Make sure you cannot use visitor accounts to login through staff login. 
+ Eric: Assisting in taking system live, monitoring system on regular basis, and ensuring that system can be appropriately taken down for maintenance and quickly restored. 
+ Hugo: Also assist in making CitP system live, provide maintenance, and work on visitor portal.
