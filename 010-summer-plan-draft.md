#Assessment

1) What did you deliver to your sponsor at the end of spring quarter? 

+ We delivered a completed website and a login system connected to a database as a basis for their electronic information storage. 
+ Passport redesigns
##### Functional Requirements met

 Database:

+ Create a database to store client information.
+ If accessed with a valid account, the database should lead to the user interface.
+ If accessed with a patient account, patients are not allowed to input information.
+ If acessed with staff accounts, staff are allowed to input and change information on patient accounts.

 Website management:
 
+ The system will provide a box on the website for users to subscribe to the Clinic in the Park emails (flyers, newsletters, etc).
+ Allow the website to have be interactive with the database and allow patients and staff to access the website for patient information.

##### Non-functional Requirements met
+ Needs to be accessibile to providers at other healthcare establishments.
+ Must be able to quickly and easily backup information.


2) What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?

##### Functional Requirements that remain to be met
 Website management:
 
+ Staff can input information into the database through the website. 
+ Patients can access database through website to look over medical information from Clinic in the Park check-ups
+ Patients can input their own medical information through the website and into the database

###### Miscellaneous
+ If a user presses the "recover password" button, it will lead the user to a page asking for the user ID and the answer for a previously picked security question.
+ If a user presses the "forgot ID and password" button, the user is sent an email to the email he or she used for making the account. 


##### Non-functional Requirements that remain to be met
+ Needs to be easily-maintainable going into the future.
+ Must be HIPAA-compliant and in line with privacy and other security concerns.
+ Usability needs to be focused on visitors and providers that attend Clinic in the Park event.
+ Needs to be portable, as the primary setting (in which data will be recorded) is outdoors at OC Great Park.
+ Needs to be reliable and efficient.
+ Must not take longer than 5 seconds to load anything.

3) What other work do you need to do to deliver the final product?
  + We need to finish implementing the login system. Other work we need to do are the following: 
  + design and implement the user interface for dashboard both the staff and visitors interact with. 
  ++ Successfully connect the database to the website. This task will be considered done if we are able to access the database through the website.
  ++ Write a tutorial and detailed documentation on maintaining the electronic system for future people modifying our work (tentative, might not be necessary). 

4) Are there some requirements for the final product that are not yet clear? If so, how can you get clear about them?
  + There are several requirements that are not yet clear. One of the requirements in our documents is: "Needs to be portable, as the primary setting (in which data will be recorded) is outdoors at OC Great Park. We are unclear whether our sponsor wants to use the electronic system for recording information during clinic events or just for information storage. This is a problem, because we would have to create some sort of offline system if they want to use the electronic system for recording during events. We plan on asking our sponsor the next time we meet.
  
5) What is the most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product?
  + The most important work to make progresss towards the final product is managing to connect to the database through the website.
  
6) What skills are needed to do this work?
 + The skills we will need are: programming in PHP/SQL, knowledge of web servers.
 
7) Who in the team has these skills? Who does not?
  + With the exception of Eric, the rest are new to programming in PHP/SQL and using web servers.  
  
8) How can team members without these skills get them?
  + Team members without these skills will be able to acquire (and reach a satisfactory level) by reading PHP/SQL documentation and working on small side projects to put their new knowledge to test.
