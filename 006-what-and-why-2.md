## What we are building

We are building an information tracking database system for the purposes of recording and pulling patient information. Patients and providers will be able to access, input, and output information by accessing the database through the Clinic in the Park website. Patients will be able to look over medical information recorded by Clinic in the Park staff, like blood pressure recordings, the last time they have had a check-up at the park, and other information useful for patients. Staff will be able to access the same information as the clients, but they are allowed to input information onto the database through the website.  


## Why we are building it

We are building this system for the purpose of recording information safely and easily, as well as providing ways for this information to be shared between providers. Clinic in the Park currently records their patient data on paper "passports" that are placed in the possession of visitors when they leave. This process is not only slow and prone to errors, but also unreliable, since passports may be lost or not brought back by visitors. Also, because information is only being stored on single documents, it cannot be shared with other health providers. If a given visitor attends health centers other than Clinic in the Park, any treatment or general healthcare they receive at Clinic in the Park will not be available to professionals at those other locations.

With the new system, patient information will be easy to record and retrieve. Both providers and patients will be able to automatically search for records they want to see. In addition, there will be less worry about losing paperwork, because everything will be stored electronically. Furthermore, readability will no longer be an issue, since input will be electronic. Lastly, records of Clinic in the Park visitors will be accessible to providers at other health centers.
