2. Create Basic GUI (include people and services creation) - We didn't quite get to it. Also, needed to throughlhy think
things through before proceeding, and decided to create mockups of the interface to better understand what needs to be done.
3. PHP Functionality - We were unable to get to this. By creating mockups, we hope to give ourselves a better understanding
of what kinds of functionality are needed, and how to bring everything together.
