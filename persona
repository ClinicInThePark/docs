Background:
	Maria is a legal immigrant from El Salvador. She moved to the U.S in hopes of creating a better life for her children. She is a single-mom and a hard worker, but due to the recession she has had her job hours cut and does not get enough hours to qualify for health insurance under her company. She has 3 small children, ages 5,6, and 8 respectively. Her 5-year old child has a weak immune system and she fears for her childâ€™s health. She cannot afford normal health insurance with her current job, and does not qualify for government aid.
	She would like to learn more about health and preventive care to avoid as many health hazards in the future as possible. However, she has trouble finding resources and is not fluent in English so she is unable to understand many English medical terms.
