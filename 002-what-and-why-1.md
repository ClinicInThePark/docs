## What we are building

We are building an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), 'put information from the requirements gathering here'


## Why we are building it

We are building this EMR system for the Clinic in the Park, for the purpose of recording information easier and safely. Currently, they record their patient data by writing it down on paper. This is slow and prone to many problems, like losing the papers and readability. 

With an EMR, patient information will be easier to record and retrieve,because users will be able to use the EMR to automatically search for records they want to see. There will also be less worry about losing paperwork, since it will be stored electronically. In addition, it will cover readability issues, since handwriting will not affect record inputting.
