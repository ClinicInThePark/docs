## What we are building

We are building an record tracking database system, for the purposes of recording and pulling patient information.  patients and staff will be able to access,input, and output patient information by accessing the database through the Clinic in the Park website. Patients will be able to look over medical information recorded by Clinic in the Park staff, like blood pressure recordings, the last time they have had a check-up at the park, and other information useful for patients. Staff will be able to access the same information as the clients, but they are allowed to input information onto the database through the website.  


## Why we are building it

We are building this system for the purpose of recording information easier and safely. Currently, they record their patient data by writing it down on paper. This is slow and prone to many problems, like losing the papers and readability. 

With this system, patient information will be easier to record and retrieve,because users will be able to use the EMR to automatically search for records they want to see. There will also be less worry about losing paperwork, since it will be stored electronically. In addition, it will cover readability issues, since handwriting will not affect record inputting.
