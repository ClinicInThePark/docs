## Week 6 - Update on Website and Passport Redesign

This week we showed them changes made to the website:
+MailChimp Integration
+Twitter Feed
+Fixed Header Links
+PayPal Integration
+Event System Management
+YouTube Video on Homepage

And the initial redesign of passport:
+Single-Item Design Example
+Overall Layout Example

The client decided that although they liked what we had done with the passport redesign, they wanted to change the design to
an overarching categories format. Instead of having information fields for individual organizations, they would like to have
all information fields fall under general categories. For example, all data for organizations pertaining to healthy nutrition
would be included under a "Nutrition" category.

## Week 7 - WordPress Dashboard Tutorial and Things We Still Need

Ran CitP Team through WordPress dashboard management. Some issues that need to be resolved:
+Need Contact for PayPal Configuration
+Resize Photos for Homepage Slider (maybe pass task to someone else with experience)
+Account Configuration for MailChimp Plugin

We still need server access. Our client sent an email (with us copied) to their web master, Mark Raymond. We are waiting
to hear back from him.
