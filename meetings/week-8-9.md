## Points of Interest

+ CitP Webmaster has finally responded to sponsors. A meeting for Friday, June 6 has been arranged for us to meet with him (and the rest of the CitP staff)
and hopefully get some sort of access to the CitP server.
+ We have been working on mockups and hope to finalize a system design in near future.
+ We have continued to familiarize ourselves with PHP/MySQL, and have tested ourselves by creating different types of functionality. For example, updating database using simple user-input forms.
+ Plan to build user creation/login/logout system for Week 10.
