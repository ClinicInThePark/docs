## Communication schedule

We will meet Kristin and the rest of the Clinic in the Park staff in person every other Friday at the Clinic in the Park offices at 9 AM.

We will have a Google Hangout session with Kristin every Friday. Meeting times will vary due to her fluctuating schedule. 

We will also email them a report of what we have done in the last week, with relevant links to changes on the working application, every Sunday by 8 PM.

## Project goals

Our goal this quarter is to produce a working, live, prototype version of the record tracking database that can be used by both patients and staff.  It will be deployed on the Clinic in the Park server and can  be accessed through the Clinic in the Park website.

## Additions to Website

- original YT video was designed to attact sponsors/organizations
...maybe have a new, shorter version that gets to heart of the mission (like 3 minutes or less)
...good idea to include Spanish subtitles
.....might also be handy to create a way to translate entire website into other languages, especially Spanish
- maybe plan on creating space for short (30 seconds) videos for each booth/station
- PayPal donation button needs to be configured
- subscribe to email newsletter button
- look at the possibility of adding some kind of interactive checklist (WP plugin?) that can display different educational messages depending on what is or is not checked
...for example, could be used to inform people about child dental care based on things they currently do (marked on checklist)
- maybe install some kind of plugin to create future maintainability with social media additions

## Plan for Sunday (4/13/2014)

As a team, we will be attending our first Clinic in the Park event on Sunday, a bit before it starts, so at roughly 9:30 AM. We will first proceed through the event as visitors (from visitor perspective), and then we will talk look at things from a top-down perspecitve, observing booth configuration and speaking with users.
