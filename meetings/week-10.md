## Points of Interest

+ CitP Webmaster was present at meeting. He will be working directly with Clinic in the Park in making the new website live.
We will not have any sort of direct access to the server.
+ Sponsors are not sure whether they want to host the tracking system with their current hosting service provider, or with
a particular UCI hosting service that is HIPPA-compliant. They will be talking with people at the UCI hosting service, and
may arrange a meeting with them for Tuesday sometime before our final presentation.
+ If we do end up hosting with their current provider, a development environment will likely be set up for us.
+ For now, we will continue developing the system locally.
