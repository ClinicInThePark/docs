## Requirements document changes

Our sponsor will work on a set of requirements that will be given to us on an incremental basis. Our first set of requirements will focus on making improvements to the development website that was created in the past quarter (Informatics 172) group project. Included in that first set of requirements will be information on what sort of data our sponsors specifically want, so that as a group we can begin to construct a database that can hold this information correctly.
