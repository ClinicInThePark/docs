## Proposed Schedule Plan

We proposed a schedule plan to our sponsors based on the class assignment schedule, including when we planned to have website changes completed, as well as a final date for when our minimum viable product will be delivered.

Our sponsors agreed with the schedule plan and our looking forward to seeing our progress over the next few weeks.

## Solution Proposal and Presentation of Use Case Flow

We pitched our idea of redesigning the Clinic in the Park visitor "passport" through a sample use case flow. Our sponsors were pleased with this solution, as it will save them money by not having to purchase devices to input data directly on site. Rather, their volunteers can be used for data entry at a later time, perhaps back in the comfort of the Clinic in the Park office.

Use Case Flow Example:

1. Visitor approaches Clinic in the Park information booth.
2. Visitor receives (redesigned) passport.
3. Visitor approaches health service booth.
4. As visitor receives health services, volunteers record data on visitor passport.
5. Passport is returned to visitor.
6. Repeat 3, 4 and 5 until visitor is ready to depart.
7. Upon departure, visitor returns passport to collection booth (or possibly information booth - whatever is most convenient).
8. In exchange, visitor is provided with login credentials to view their data through website portal.
