We will write documents and post them through GitHub as well as work collaboratively through Google Docs.

## Miscellaneous

We agree to communicate regularly, even if the news is bad.

Every person commits to attending scheduled meetings and co-working hours.

We will tell our teammates as early as we can if we can't make a meeting or work session.

We agree to volunteer to take on tasks and do them well and on time as best we can.

If we don't know how to do something, we will do our best to figure it out. We will ask for help if we get stuck.
