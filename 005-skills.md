#Team Member Coding Potential

## Team member Name: Ka Lun Lee
2. How well can you code? Can code "okay"

3. HTML: a couple of times
   CSS: a couple of times
   MySQL: a couple of times
   PHP: once
   CakePHP framework: 
   Javascript: a couple of times
   
4. To contribute fully to this project, I would need to learn PHP and have mastery of 
all the other languages. 

5. I will spend 3-4 hours each day on learning and mastering PHP as well as gaining mastery on 
the other languages.

6. I plan on doing this everyday either after I finish class and homework, and during class gaps, because I usually have
2-3 hour gaps between classes. 

7. During the learning period, I will either be at Donald Bren Hall, since I have all my classes there and there is a quiet area to study
or at my own apartment. 

8. My plan is to fully read a PHP e-book called "PHP Essentials" and read at least 2 chapters a day while completing the assignments
provided by the textbook. I also plan on using other resources like stackoverflow.com in case I need help. 

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by sharing a document of what I covered that day which will include interesting
things I learned or things that I should keep in mind for the future.

2. How well can you code? Can code "okay"

3. HTML: a couple of times (most recently last quarter)
   CSS: a couple of times (most recently last quarter)
   MySQL: never
   PHP: never
   CakePHP framework: never heard of it
   Javascrip: a couple of times

4. To contribute fully to this project, I need to focus on improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and reading up and learning on MySQL, PHP, and CakePHP framework (since I have never worked with these languages before).

5. I will spend 2-3 hours every day since I have gaps during class and work to learn more on these languages, and then use my weekends to spend between 4-5 hours learning.

6. I plan on learning after class and work, in my gaps and once I get home, and definitely during weekends, when I have the most free time.

7. During the learning period, I will be at Donald Bren Hall, I have classes for most of the day there and have access to a study room where I can study. I will personally try to avoid my apartment since I get easily distracted.

8. My plan on learning is to go through online tutorials such as w3Schools (w3schools.com/PHP, w3schools.com/sql), CodeCademy (codecademy.com/tracks/php), and using books to learn more on HTML and CSS (CSS: Web Programming and Internet Technologies: An E-commerce Approach). I plan on going through these tutorials and reading the books at least once-twice a day (reading through 2 sections a day during the week, and trying to do 3 chapters during the weekend). Any time I have questions I will consult with team members that have more experience than me or go on websites such as stackoverflow.com. 

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by also sharing on a document that will talk about what I have been working on for that particular day, what I may have questions on, and what I plan on learning on next.

3. HTML: a couple of times
   CSS: never
   MySQL: a couple of tmes
   PHP: never 
   CakePHP framework: never heard of it
   Javascript: once 

4. To contribute fully to this project, I need to enchance my coding skills in HTML, MySQL and Javascript. I will also need to learn CSS, PHP, and CakePHP framework.

5. I will dedicate 2-3 hours each day to learning these languages. I plan on spending lots of time reading and researching about these languages including tutorials and several programming excercises. 

6. I plan on doing this every evening once I get off from school and work which is usually around 8PM. I also plan on setting aside some time on my weekends that will be dedicated to studying these languages. 

7. During the learning period, I will be at home. I personally work better in a quiet and comfortable environment where I have access to my own resources (27' dual monitor setup along with two additional laptops). 

8. My plan on learning is to utilize as much online resources as possible, such as CodeAcademy (for CSS and PHP) and Eloquent JavaScript (a free ebook). I plan on going through two sections on CodeAcademy and two chapters on Eloquent JavaScript per day. Anytime I run into any struggles or have any questions I will use stackoverflow.com to help me.

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by also sharing on a document of what I have been working on, what I've learned, what interesting things that I learned that could be essential to other team members, and what questions I have (if any).

2. How well can you code? "pretty good"

3. HTML: "lots and lots"
   CSS: "lots and lots"
   MySQL: "lots and lots"
   PHP: "a couple times"
   CakePHP Framework: "never heard of it"
   JavaScript: "a couple times"

4. Need to learn how to use CakePHP framework, and refresh myself on all languages being used.

5. I will dedicate roughly 20 to 30 hours over the next two weeks in preparation for execution.

6. I will be setting aside time on evenings from 8:00 to 11:00 PM. I will also set aside arbitrary times during weekends to continue preparation.

7. All preparation will be done at my home work station, which is quiet and comfortable. I learn best there.

8. I will be going through the official CakePHP documentation located at http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/tutorials-and-examples.html, as well as refreshing myself on PHP and JavaScript with these tutorials from TheNewBoston, respectively: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL442FA2C127377F07 and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL46F0A159EC02DF82. I have used TheNewBoston tutorials in the past with much success.

9. I will share a document with my team in which I will share my progress, as well as highlight important things that will be helpful for all of us to know as we begin execution of the project.
