#Team Member Coding Potential

## Team member Name: Ka Lun Lee
2. How well can you code? Can code "okay"

3. HTML: a couple of times
   CSS: a couple of times
   MySQL: a couple of times
   PHP: once
   CakePHP framework: 
   Javascript: a couple of times
   
4. To contribute fully to this project, I would need to learn PHP and have mastery of 
all the other languages. 

5. I will spend 3-4 hours each day on learning and mastering PHP as well as gaining mastery on 
the other languages.

6. I plan on doing this everyday either after I finish class and homework, and during class gaps, because I usually have
2-3 hour gaps between classes. 

7. During the learning period, I will either be at Donald Bren Hall, since I have all my classes there and there is a quiet area to study
or at my own apartment. 

8. My plan is to fully read a PHP e-book called "PHP Essentials" and read at least 2 chapters a day while completing the assignments
provided by the textbook. I also plan on using other resources like stackoverflow.com in case I need help. 

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by sharing a document of what I covered that day which will include interesting
things I learned or things that I should keep in mind for the future.

2. How well can you code? Can code "okay"

3. HTML: a couple of times (most recently last quarter)
   CSS: a couple of times (most recently last quarter)
   MySQL: never
   PHP: never
   CakePHP framework: never heard of it
   Javascrip: a couple of times

4. To contribute fully to this project, I need to focus on improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and reading up and learning on MySQL, PHP, and CakePHP framework (since I have never worked with these languages before).

5. I will spend 2-3 hours every day since I have gaps during class and work to learn more on these languages, and then use my weekends to spend between 4-5 hours learning.

6. I plan on learning after class and work, in my gaps and once I get home, and definitely during weekends, when I have the most free time.

7. During the learning period, I will be at Donald Bren Hall, I have classes for most of the day there and have access to a study room where I can study. I will personally try to avoid my apartment since I get easily distracted.

8. My plan on learning is to go through online tutorials such as w3Schools (w3schools.com/PHP, w3schools.com/sql), CodeCademy (codecademy.com/tracks/php), and using books to learn more on HTML and CSS (CSS: ). I plan on going through these tutorials and reading the books at least once-twice a day (reading through 2 sections a day during the week, and trying to do 3 chapters during the weekend). Any time I have questions I will consult with team members that have more experience than me or go on websites such as stackoverflow.com. 

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by also sharing on a document that will talk about what I have been working on for that particular day, what I may have questions on, and what I plan on learning on next.
