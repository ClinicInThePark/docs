4. To contribute fully to this project, I would need to learn PHP and have mastery of 
all the other languages. 

5. I will spend 3-4 hours each day on learning and mastering PHP as well as gaining mastery on 
the other languages.

6. I plan on doing this everyday either after I finish class and homework, and during class gaps, because I usually have
2-3 hour gaps between classes. 

7. During the learning period, I will either be at Donald Bren Hall, since I have all my classes there and there is a quiet area to study
or at my own apartment. 

8. My plan is to fully read a PHP e-book called "PHP Essentials" and read at least 2 chapters a day while completing the assignments
provided by the textbook. I also plan on using other resources like stackoverflow.com in case I need help. 

9. I will communicate my learning to my team by sharing a document of what I covered that day which will include interesting
things I learned or things that I should keep in mind for the future.
